## Overview

This service automates Livepeer orchestrator operations by monitoring the Livepeer round lifecycle and executing actions based on on-chain round state.

The application performs the following tasks:

1. **Reward Claiming**: Calls `rewardWithHint()` exactly once per round when a new round is initialized
2. **Bond Transfer**: Transfers bonded LPT from the orchestrator wallet once the round is locked, while retaining a minimum bonded balance
3. **Fee Withdrawal**: Withdraws accumulated ETH fees when they exceed a configurable threshold

The application runs continuously using a polling loop and safely retries failed actions on subsequent iterations.

### Key Dependencies

- **tokio**: Async runtime for concurrent operations
- **ethers**: Ethereum/Arbitrum blockchain interaction library
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **serde/serde_json**: Serialization/deserialization
- **tracing**: Structured logging and diagnostics
- **chrono**: Date and time utilities

### Smart Contract Integration

The application interacts with two Livepeer Protocol smart contracts on Arbitrum:

- **BondingManager** (`0x35Bcf3c30594191d53231E4FF333E8A770453e40`): Manages staking, bonding, and fee operations
- **RoundsManager** (`0xdd6f56DcC28D3F5f27084381fE8Df634985cc39f`): Manages protocol rounds and their states

## Features

- **Round-Aware Rewarding**: Calls `rewardWithHint()` once per initialized round using on-chain state to prevent duplicates
- **Reward Hints**: Computes the orchestrator's new position in the transcoder pool so the contract skips its linear search (see [Reward Hints](#reward-hints))
- **Automated LPT Transfer**: Transfers all excess bonded LPT while retaining a minimum bonded amount on the orchestrator
- **Fee Management**: Withdraws accumulated ETH fees above a configurable threshold
- **Round Safety**: Bond transfers and fee withdrawals only occur when the round is locked
- **Polling-Based Execution**: Runs continuously and reacts to round state changes
- **Keystore-Based Signing**: Uses encrypted JSON keystore and passphrase files (no private keys in env vars)
- **Configurable**: All operational parameters controlled via environment variables
- **Logging**: Structured logging suitable for auditing and monitoring
- **Docker Support**: Production-ready containerization
- **Error Handling**: No panics; failures are logged and retried on the next polling cycle

## Prerequisites

### Development

- Rust 1.90.0 or later
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- Access to an Arbitrum RPC endpoint
- Encrypted Ethereum keystore file (JSON format)
- Passphrase file for keystore decryption

### Production

- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes/orchestration platform (optional)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd livepeer-funds-transfer
```

### Install Rust (if not already installed)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Logging configuration
RUST_LOG=funds_transfer=info

# Arbitrum RPC endpoint
HTTP_RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc

# Path to encrypted keystore file
JSON_KEY_FILE=/path/to/keystore.json

# Path to keystore passphrase file
PASSPHRASE_FILE=/path/to/passphrase.txt

# Optional: orchestrator address (derived from keystore if omitted)
# ORCHESTRATOR_ADDR=0xYourOrchestratorAddress

# Recipient address for transferred bonded LPT
LPT_RECEIVER_ADDR=0xYourStakeRecipientAddress

# Minimum bonded LPT to retain on the orchestrator (wei)
# Example: 1 LPT = 1000000000000000000
LPT_MIN_RETAIN_WEI=1000000000000000000

# Recipient address for withdrawn ETH fees
ETH_FEE_RECEIVER_ADDR=0xYourFeeRecipientAddress

# Minimum ETH fees required before withdrawal (wei)
# Example:          0.03 ETH = 30000000000000000
ETH_FEE_WITHDRAW_THRESHOLD_WEI=30000000000000000

# Chain ID (Arbitrum One = 42161)
CHAIN_ID=42161

# Polling interval in seconds
LOOP_SLEEP_SECS=60

```

### Configuration Details

#### RPC_ENDPOINT_URL
- Public Arbitrum RPC: `https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc`
- Consider using a dedicated RPC provider (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode) for production
- Rate limits may apply to public endpoints

#### Wallet Setup

1. **Generate Keystore**:
   ```bash
   # Using geth or similar tool
   geth account new --keystore ./keystore
   ```

2. **Create Passphrase File**:
   ```bash
   echo "your-secure-passphrase" > passphrase.txt
   chmod 600 passphrase.txt
   ```

3. **Security Note**: Never commit keystore files or passphrases to version control

#### Address Configuration

- **ORCH_ETH_ADDR**: The orchestrator wallet that holds bonded LPT and accumulates fees
- **TRANSFER_BOND_RECIPIENT_ETH_ADDR**: Destination for transferred LPT bonds (typically your main staking wallet)
- **ETH_FEE_RECIPIENT_ETH_ADDR**: Destination for withdrawn ETH fees (can be the same as bond recipient)

#### Operational Parameters

All operational parameters are configurable via environment variables:

- **LPT_MIN_RETAIN_WEI**  
  Minimum bonded LPT that must remain on the orchestrator after transfers. An empty value is rejected at startup (it would otherwise read as 0 and transfer the entire stake); set `"0"` explicitly if that is really intended.

- **ETH_FEE_WITHDRAW_THRESHOLD_WEI**  
  ETH fees must meet or exceed this value before withdrawal.

- **LOOP_SLEEP_SECS**  
  Polling interval. Failed actions are retried on the next loop iteration.

- **MAX_FEE_BASE_MULTIPLIER** (default `2`)  
  Transactions are sent with `maxFeePerGas = baseFee * MAX_FEE_BASE_MULTIPLIER + MAX_PRIORITY_FEE_WEI`, using the latest block's base fee. Raise it if transactions sit pending during base-fee spikes.

- **MAX_PRIORITY_FEE_WEI** (default `0`)  
  Priority fee (tip). Arbitrum does not pay tips to the sequencer, so `0` is normally correct.

These values can be adjusted without rebuilding the application.

## Building

### Development Build

```bash
cargo build
```

### Release Build (Optimized)

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be located at:
- Debug: `./target/debug/funds_transfer`
- Release: `./target/release/funds_transfer`

### Build with Specific Features

```bash
# With all features
cargo build --all-features

# Check for compilation errors without building
cargo check
```

## Testing

```bash
# Unit + property tests (offline)
cargo test

# Fork test: sends real rewardWithHint txs for every active orchestrator on an
# anvil fork of Arbitrum and checks each lands exactly at the hinted position
# with the predicted reward. Needs Foundry's anvil and network access; ~30 min
# for the full pool. The public RPC may prune the fork block's state before a full
# run ends; use an archive RPC or split it with FORK_TEST_SKIP / FORK_TEST_LIMIT.
cargo test --test reward_hints_fork -- --ignored --nocapture
FORK_TEST_LIMIT=10 ARB_RPC_URL=https://your-rpc cargo test --test reward_hints_fork -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The unit tests pin the reward math to real mainnet `Reward` events, and a property
test checks that hints always satisfy `SortedDoublyLL.validInsertPosition` on random pools.

## Running

### Local Execution

1. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   # Using cargo (development)
   cargo run

   # Or run the compiled binary
   ./target/release/funds_transfer
   ```

3. **With custom logging**:
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
   ```

### Application Behavior

The application operates in a continuous loop:

1. Loads configuration and decrypts the keystore
2. Polls the Livepeer `RoundsManager` contract to determine:
   - Current round number
   - Whether the round is initialized
   - Whether the round is locked
3. If the round is initialized:
   - Calls `rewardWithHint()` once per round if it has not already been called
4. If the round is locked:
   - Transfers bonded LPT in excess of `LPT_MIN_RETAIN_WEI`
   - Withdraws ETH fees if they exceed the configured threshold
5. Sleeps for `LOOP_SLEEP_SECS`
6. Repeats

If a transaction fails, the error is logged and the operation is retried on the next polling cycle.

### Stopping the Application

- Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop
- The application will complete its current operation before exiting

## Docker Deployment

### Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t livepeer-funds-transfer:latest .
```

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name livepeer-funds-transfer \
  --env-file .env \
  -v /path/to/keystore:/root/keystore \
  -v /path/to/passphrase.txt:/root/passphrase.txt \
  livepeer-funds-transfer:latest
```

### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  funds-transfer:
    build: .
    container_name: livepeer-funds-transfer
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./keystore:/root/keystore:ro
      - ./passphrase.txt:/root/passphrase.txt:ro
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```

Run with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Multi-Stage Build Benefits

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build:
1. **Builder stage**: Compiles the Rust application with all dependencies
2. **Runtime stage**: Creates minimal Debian-based image with only the binary

This reduces the final image size significantly (from ~2GB to ~100MB).

## Operations

### Monitoring

#### Log Messages

The application provides detailed logging at various levels:

```

### Transaction Verification

After each transaction, verify on Arbiscan:
- Bond transfers: Check BondingManager contract events
- Fee withdrawals: Check ETH transfers to recipient address

### Health Checks

Monitor for:
- Regular log output every 60 seconds
- Successful transaction hashes
- No error messages in logs
- Recipient wallet balances increasing

```

### Reward Hints

The transcoder pool is a linked list sorted by stake. `reward()` re-inserts the
orchestrator with its new stake by walking the list from the top; `rewardWithHint(prev, next)`
skips the walk when given the correct neighbours. Before each reward the app:

1. Predicts the reward exactly as the contracts do: `Minter.currentMintableTokens` ×
   the orchestrator's earnings-pool stake ÷ `currentRoundTotalActiveStake` (MathUtilsV2,
   1e9 precision), minus `treasuryRewardCutRate`
2. Walks the pool from the head until it reaches the first orchestrator with less stake
   than `currentStake + reward`
3. Logs `reward hints: prev=… next=… stakeWei=… expectedRewardWei=…` and sends `rewardWithHint`

Stale or wrong hints never cause a revert; the contract falls back to searching from
them. If computing hints fails, the app sends `rewardWithHint(0x0, 0x0)`, which is
identical to `reward()`. Savings grow with pool depth. Measured on an Arbitrum fork
across all 100 pool positions: ~4% gas for the top 10, ~30% for positions 30–59, ~43%
for 60–87 and ~49% for the bottom 12 (≈1.02M → ≈515k gas); 33% overall. With hints, gas
stays at ~490–550k regardless of position.

## Security Considerations

### Key Management

1. **Keystore Protection**:
   - Store keystore files in secure locations with restricted permissions (`chmod 600`)
   - Use strong passphrases (20+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
   - Never commit keystores to version control
   - Consider hardware wallets for production environments

2. **Passphrase Security**:
   - Store passphrase files separately from keystores
   - Use environment variables or secrets management systems in production
   - Rotate passphrases regularly

### Network Security

1. **RPC Endpoints**:
   - Use authenticated RPC endpoints when possible
   - Consider running your own Arbitrum node for maximum security
   - Implement rate limiting and request filtering

2. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Restrict outbound connections to necessary RPC endpoints
   - Block all inbound connections except monitoring

### Operational Security

1. **Minimum Privilege**:
   - Run the application with minimal necessary permissions
   - Use dedicated service accounts
   - Implement principle of least privilege

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for failed transactions
   - Monitor wallet balances regularly
   - Track gas costs and fee withdrawals

3. **Auditing**:
   - Review logs regularly
   - Verify all transactions on-chain
   - Maintain audit trail of configuration changes

### Smart Contract Risks

1. **Contract Addresses**: The hardcoded Livepeer contract addresses are for Arbitrum mainnet. Verify these before deployment.
2. **Protocol Upgrades**: Monitor Livepeer governance for protocol upgrades that might affect these addresses
3. **Gas Prices**: Fees are derived from the latest base fee (see `MAX_FEE_BASE_MULTIPLIER`); gas limits come from `eth_estimateGas`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "HTTP_RPC_URL missing"
**Cause**: Environment variable not set
**Solution**: 
```bash
export HTTP_RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
# Or add to .env file
```

#### 2. "could not load wallet with key and passphrase provided"
**Cause**: Incorrect passphrase or corrupted keystore
**Solution**: 
- Verify passphrase file contains correct passphrase (no trailing newlines)
- Ensure keystore file is valid JSON
- Check file permissions

#### 3. "Transfer Bond Transaction failed"
**Causes**:
- Insufficient gas
- Round not properly locked
- Invalid recipient address
- Insufficient LPT balance

**Solution**: 
- Check wallet has enough ETH for gas
- Verify round status on Livepeer Explorer
- Confirm recipient address is valid
- Review logs for specific error messages

#### 4. "gas required exceeds allowance"
**Cause**: `eth_estimateGas` caps gas at `walletBalance / maxFeePerGas`. Versions up to 0.0.5 used ethers' mainnet fee defaults (a 3 gwei minimum tip), which is ~100x the Arbitrum base fee, so a wallet holding less than ~0.003 ETH could not estimate `reward()` (~700k–900k gas).
**Solution**: 
- Upgrade to a version that prices fees from the base fee (`MAX_FEE_BASE_MULTIPLIER`)
- Keep a small ETH buffer on the orchestrator wallet for gas

#### 5. Connection timeouts
**Cause**: RPC endpoint unreachable or rate limited
**Solution**:
- Try alternative RPC endpoint
- Use authenticated/paid RPC service
- Increase timeout values (requires code modification)

#### 5. "Current Round is not locked"
**Cause**: Normal operation - rounds are not always locked
**Solution**: Wait for next round lock (rounds lock periodically in Livepeer protocol)

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```

Or for even more detail:
```bash
RUST_LOG=trace cargo run
```

### Testing Without Transactions

To test configuration without executing real transactions, you can:
1. Use a testnet (change CHAIN_ID to 421614 for Arbitrum Sepolia)
2. Modify the code to add a "dry-run" mode
3. Use a test wallet with minimal funds

### Getting Help

1. Check application logs first
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test RPC connectivity: `curl -X POST $HTTP_RPC_URL -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'`
4. Verify wallet address has necessary permissions in Livepeer protocol
5. Review Livepeer Protocol documentation for round and staking mechanics

### Using Alternative Networks

For Arbitrum Sepolia testnet:
```bash
CHAIN_ID=421614
HTTP_RPC_URL=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
```

Update contract addresses in code if different on testnet.

## Performance Considerations

- **RPC Rate Limits**: The 30-minute polling interval is conservative. Adjust based on your RPC provider's limits
- **Gas Costs**: Monitor gas prices on Arbitrum - typically very low compared to mainnet
- **Memory Usage**: Application uses minimal memory (~10-20MB) during operation
- **CPU Usage**: Negligible except during transaction signing
